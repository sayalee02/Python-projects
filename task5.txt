File handling is an integral part of programming. File handling in Python is simplified with built-in methods, 
which include creating, opening, and closing files.
While files are open, Python additionally allows performing various file operations, 
such as reading, writing, and appending information.
The open() function takes two elementary parameters for file handling:
1. The file_name includes the file extension and assumes the file is in the current working directory.
If the file location is elsewhere, provide the absolute or relative path.
2. The mode is an optional parameter that defines the file opening method.
